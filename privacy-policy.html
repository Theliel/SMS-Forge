# SMS Forge Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how the mobile application **SMS Forge**, developed by **Theliel**, collects, uses, and protects your information.

**SMS Forge** is designed to respect your privacy. The application does not require internet access and does not collect any personal user information unless you actively choose to use a specific debugging feature.

## Information We Collect

The **SMS Forge** application only collects the following information when the user enables the **debugging** option. All data is obfuscated and stored only locally on the user's device.

The data that may be collected includes:

* **General device information:** Model, brand, and operating system to understand the application's environment.
* **SMS information:** The messages sent from the application, as well as the settings and parameters used for their delivery.
* **Diagnostic and error data:** Information about potential app failures or errors to aid in troubleshooting and bug fixing.

## How and Why We Collect Information

The information mentioned above is collected **solely and exclusively** for the purpose of **diagnosing and fixing application errors**, and to improve the user experience.

Data collection for debugging is **completely optional**. The user must enable this function manually. Once the data is collected locally, the user has the option to send an encrypted log file to the developer by email for analysis. The application will not send this information automatically.

## Data Storage and Security

All information collected by the debugging feature is stored securely and **only locally** on the user's device. The application does not transmit this information to any server or any other location.

The information collected for debugging is **automatically deleted** from the device the moment the user disables the debugging option.

Additionally, if the user decides to explicitly send this data to the developer, the developer commits to **deleting said information within a maximum of 30 days** after receiving it, once it has been used for diagnostic and error correction purposes.

## Third-Party Services

**SMS Forge** uses **Google Play Services** to manage in-app purchases. Google Play Services has its own Privacy Policy, which you can consult on their website.

The application does not share any user information with other third parties.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy in the future. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed of any changes.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact the developer at the email address provided on the app's listing page in the Google Play Store.
